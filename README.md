# ðŸš€ GitLab CI/CD with Docker - Automated Deployment Pipeline

This project showcases the implementation of a CI/CD pipeline using GitLab CI/CD and Docker to automate the build and deployment process of a static web application.

It demonstrates how to:

Use GitLab CI/CD to define a custom pipeline with stages like build and deploy.

Leverage Docker to containerize the application for consistent and reproducible environments.

Automatically build a Docker image and deploy a static website using Nginx as the web server.

Enable seamless, automated delivery of code from commit to container execution.

This setup is ideal for learning and applying modern DevOps practices, particularly in the areas of automation, containerization, and continuous deployment workflows.
